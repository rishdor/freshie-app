# Virtual Fridge: A Mobile App for Home Food Inventory Management

## Project Overview

This project is a mobile application designed to help users track their home food inventory. It's an university project developed using Agile methodologies for project management.

The application serves as a virtual fridge, but it's not limited to just that! By adding products and assigning an expiration date to them, the app will not only remind you of what might start to go bad in your kitchen, but also give you recommendations on what you can prepare with those items. 

## Features (work in progress)

- **Home Food Inventory Tracking**: Keep track of all the food items in your home.
- **Recipes List**: Store your favorite recipes for easy access.
- **Automatic Groceries List**: Maintain a list of groceries to buy. The app automatically generates it based on your purchases.
- **Recipe Recommendation**: Get recommendations for recipes based on the items in your inventory.

## Technologies Used

The application is developed using C#, .NET MAUI, and APIs. HTTP requests are used for communication with the backend.

We have built our own database and API to manage data like users, products, etc. Additionally, we have utilized an open-source database for recipes.
